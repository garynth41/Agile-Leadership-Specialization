Outstanding job. Congrats on completing the
module and the course. We have covered a lot. Let's review the key
concepts of this module. To achieve the vision of
becoming an agile leader, you have to take
consistent action daily, weekly, and monthly. The true power of knowledge is in the application of the tools and principles you have discovered. It's in the experimentation, reflection, and
continuous improvement. There are three
pitfalls you might encounter in your journey: not having enough time,
accountability, or commitment. Use the strategies we have
discussed to overcome these. To follow up on taking action and to overcome the
three pitfalls, design your daily rituals. Block off time on your
calendar and then protect it. The pleasure principle is
foundational to taking action, changing mindsets,
beliefs, and experiences. Use the pleasure and pain principle to forge
new associations. A consistent practice of
finding new experiences will help you level up
your change resiliency. Look for experiences
that are moderately uncomfortable and
celebrate your victories once you complete these. By creating your reward and pleasure association with
the new experiences, over time, you will be able to tackle more difficult
and complex changes. Congratulations on
completing this course. It's been a pleasure
guiding you on the journey of agile
transformation. This is probably one of
the most difficult courses because it requires
blunt self-honesty, courage, and truly tests your commitment to
becoming an agile leader. I trust that you will take action with the help of tools you learn, not only during this
course, but also afterward. Thanks for spending the
last five weeks with me and thanks for your commitment to becoming an agile leader. Now that you know how
to transform yourself, you will be able to apply the same principles
to your teams. In the next course, you will learn the tools and principles for leading your team to agility in the resiliency
in times of change.
