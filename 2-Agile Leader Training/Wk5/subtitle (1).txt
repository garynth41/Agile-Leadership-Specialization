Welcome back. In this lesson, you will learn the last key tool that will support you in building an agile mindset and new behavior; the
pleasure principle. The pleasure principle
suggests that humans have an instinctive tendency to seek out pleasure and avoid pain. It's a simple principle
which gives us an insight into how to
manipulate our habit formation. Whenever you want to install a new habit or change a belief, you will first have to associate tremendous psychological
pain to particular action or thought you're trying
to remove and link enormous pleasure to the
one you desire to adopt. Questions will help you
develop these associations. To develop a pain associations, you have to unpack a
long-term implication of thought or behavior. For example, you
might ask yourself, what consequences
will I experience if I continue with these
particular thoughts? How will it limit my potential, 1, 5, 10, and 20 years later? What opportunities and
experiences will I miss out on if I continue having
these thoughts and beliefs? What will it cost me
if I don't change? To develop a pleasure
association, you have to list all
positive benefits a thought or behavior would
have on you in long-term. For example, you
might ask yourself, how will my life improve as a
result of this change in 1, 5, 10, and 20 years? What will I gain by changing? What could I achieve if
I change this belief? Once you develop an association, you must commit to
taking action by ending your suffering
and choosing pleasure. The pleasure principle
is foundational in the path to agile
transformation. Knowing the mechanics
of this principle will give you the ability to
change your mindset, your beliefs, and
your experiences. It will also help you
lead your team or your organization because it's universal across
different cultures. I'll see you in the next lesson.
