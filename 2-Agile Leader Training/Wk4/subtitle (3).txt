Congrats on completing the module. Let's review the key concepts. One, positive psychology is
a subfield of psychology. It teaches us the power of
shifting our perspective and outlines the path to well-being
through the primal model. Two, by identifying our source of energy
in activities that replenishes us, we can support our
transformation long-term. We can't give more even to ourselves
if we don't have more to give. Three, stillness provides
a road map to mind mastery. Stillness is a form of psychological
training of shifting from engaging with our thoughts
to observing them. Three, stillness provides

training of shifting from engaging with thoughts to observing them. By actively disengaging with our thoughts, we can train our brains to be
less reactive and more resilient. Four, reflection is a practice
of acknowledging and processing your thoughts and experiences. Reflection is the key element for building
self awareness, for taking action, for processing emotions, and ultimately for
transforming ourselves into agile leaders. If you were to take just one
tool out of this course, this would be the tool to
incorporate in your daily rituals. Five, gratitude helps us to
override negativity bias and focus on the positive things in our lives. Gratitude is a quick way of pulling
ourselves out of negative personal stories. In the next module, you will learn best
practices for turning knowledge into action and overcoming the pitfalls
of an agile leader transformation.
