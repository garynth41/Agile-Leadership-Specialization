Congratulations on completing another module,
you're doing great. Now, let's review
the key concepts. Social psychology is the
study of how the thoughts, feelings and beliefs and
behavior of people are formed and the influence
within the social context. Social psychology
provides key insights into human motivation
and behavior. These insights help
leaders execute change management
initiative successfully. Susan Fisk, developer model of five underlying social motives. These are belonging,
understanding, controlling, trusting,
and self-enhancing. These motives or in
other words needs, point to what each
of us is seeking to satisfy on a daily basis. Belonging is the need to create and maintain social connections. It's at the core of the model. Understanding is the
need for shared meaning. This is the need for
knowing that you and the rest of the group
see things the same way. Controlling is the need
for a perceived dependency between a certain behavior
and a particular outcome. Trusting is the willingness
of an individual to be vulnerable and the need to
see others as kind and good. Self-enhancing is the need for maintaining self-esteem
and improving it. During change, the
degree to which these motives have
satisfied, maybe threatened. It's important for us as
leaders to actively monitor these five needs
and to know how to influence the level of
satisfaction of a team, which I covered in
previous lessons. Remember, it's always good to ask your team for a list of ideas from which you could
choose and match it to the need you're
trying to influence. Thanks for watching. I will
see you in the next video.
